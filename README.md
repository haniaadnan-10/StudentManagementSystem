# StudentManagementSystem
This project is a simple Student Management System created using C++. It allows you to easily manage student records by performing CRUD operations. The system is intended to be a simple, yet effective tool for learning basic C++ concepts like vectors, and menu.

## Features
- **Add Students**: Easily add student names to the system for management.
- **View All Students**: View all entered student names and their positions in the system.
- **Update Student Information**: Modify the name of any student using their index.
- **Delete Students**: Remove a student from the system by specifying their index.

## Future Improvements
- **File Handling**: Implement a feature to store student data persistently in a text file (e.g., students.txt), so the data remains available after the program closes.
- **Input Validation**: Add better validation to ensure that users can only input valid data (e.g., preventing negative index numbers or invalid student names).
